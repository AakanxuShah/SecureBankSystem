# A Web Based Secure Bank System

The purpose of Secure Banking system project is to
provide a banking interface for different types of users
and banking staffs with security measures. I have
developed this project with the team of nine members.
The project is divided into two main aspects. First one
is functionality and second aspect is security aspect of
the system. In the functionality aspect of the system, we
have focused on how functions of the project are
working and the security aspect focuses on how much
the system is secured and how it would perform under
attack. The whole project was divided into the tasks
and then each task was developed by team members.
Each member of the team took park in designing as
well as the developing phase.
